# isopod_cpp
Trivial text adventure game to make a basic cmake build script

## If cmake and ninja are better than the alternatives
how bad are the alternatives.

"There is no way to just do a compile, says the only language that can't just do a compile"

This only builds with Clion. Only Clion can detect the tool chain and make sure the CmakeCache.txt is filled out 
correctly. And even when that is filled out correctly, there doesn't appear to be any way to invoke cmake from
the terminal.

0 stars for the unboxing experience.
